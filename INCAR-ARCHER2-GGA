SYSTEM = PerovskiteArtem

!Start Parameters:
 ISTART = 1        (Read existing wavefunction) 
 INIWAV = 1        (Random initial wavefunction)

!Parallel Options: 
 LPLANE = .TRUE.   (Real space distribution)

! Briefly tested for scaling on a small MAPI GGA job
 NCORE  = 64       'set to number of cores per compute node' 
 KPAR   = 16       'set to integer divisor of the total number of cores'

!Electronic Relaxation:
! PREC  = Normal  (Precision level)
 LREAL = Auto    (Projection operators: automatic)
 ENMAX = 700 eV    (Plane-wave cutoff) 
 NELM  = 40        (Max number of SCF steps)   
 EDIFF = 1E-07     (SCF convergence) 
 GGA   =  PS       (PBE exchange-correlation)

!Ionic Relaxation:
 EDIFFG =  -0.001    (Ionic convergence)
 ISMEAR =      0     (Gaussian smearing, Metals:1, MP)

 SIGMA  =      0.001  (Smearing in eV, Metals:0.2)


ISIF=2
IBRION=2
POTIM=0.1 # don't blow up with organics...

ALGO   = Fast # recommended for MD (fall back ALGO = Fast)
